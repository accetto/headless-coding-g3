***

This Docker Hub repository contains Docker images for headless working with the popular programming language [Python][python] and its package installer [pip][pip].

The images are based on the current [Debian 12][docker-debian] and include [Xfce][xfce] desktop, [TigerVNC][tigervnc] server and [noVNC][novnc] client.

The free open-source programming editor [Visual Studio Code][vscode] in [portable installation][vscode-portable] and the popular web browsers [Chromium][chromium] or [Firefox][firefox] are also included.

Adding more tools like, for example, the most popular Python GUI frameworks [TKinter][tkinter], [PyQt5][pyqt5], [PyQT for Python][pyside] (`PySide2` or `PySide6`), [wxPython][wxpython] or [Kivy][kivy] usually requires only a single or just a few commands.
The instructions are in the provided README files and some simple test applications are also already included.

This [User guide][this-user-guide] describes the images and how to use them.

The related [GitHub project][this-github] contains image generators that image users generally donâ€™t need, unless they want to build the images themselves.

### Tags

### Remarks

The related [GitHub project][this-github] contains also the branch `bonus-images-python-gui-frameworks`, which allows building images already including the most popular Python GUI frameworks (see above).
Those images could be occasionally pushed to Docker Hub, but there will be no effort to do it regularly.
However, you can built them yourself.

This is the **third generation** (G3) of my headless images.
The **second generation** (G2) contains the GitHub repository [accetto/xubuntu-vnc-novnc][accetto-github-xubuntu-vnc-novnc].
The **first generation** (G1) contains the GitHub repository [accetto/ubuntu-vnc-xfce][accetto-github-ubuntu-vnc-xfce].

Note that the portable `Visual Studio Code` does not support automatic updates.
However, manual updating is really easy.
Visit the official [Portable Mode][vscode-portable] page for more information.

Alternatively you can pull or build an updated `accetto` image containing the new `Visual Studio Code` version.
