# Readme `flask-test-app`

This is a very simple web application for testing the `Flask` web framework.

## Prerequisites

First install `Flask`:

```shell
pip install flask
```

**Hint**: It is recommended to use an image that includes also **Chromium** or **Firefox** web browser. Then you can test your web application all inside the container.

## Starting test application

The test application can be started by:

```shell
### PWD = /srv/samples/flask-test-app
flask run
```

Then navigate the local web browser (inside the container) to the URL http://localhost:5000.

## What next

You can start by checking the [Flask documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/).
