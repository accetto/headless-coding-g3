# Readme `Angular`

This Docker image **does not** come with any pre-installed `Angular` version by intention. That allows you to choose the version and the way of installation that suite you best.

Everything else you need is already included.

You can install `Angular` globally by:

```shell
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

You can check the current `Angular` version by:

```shell
ng --version
```

You can start by following the [Angular Documentation](https://angular.io/docs).
