***

This Docker Hub repository contains Docker images for headless working with the [Postman][postman] desktop application.

The images are based on the current [Debian 13][docker-debian] and include [Xfce][xfce] desktop, [TigerVNC][tigervnc] server and [noVNC][novnc] client.

The popular web browsers [Brave][brave], [Chromium][chromium] or [Firefox][firefox] are also included.

Adding more tools like, for example, [Newman][newman] usually requires only a single or just a few commands. The instructions are in the [provided README file][this-readme-postman-newman].

This [User guide][this-user-guide] describes the images and how to use them.

The related [GitHub project][this-github] contains image generators that image users generally donâ€™t need, unless they want to build the images themselves.

### Remarks

The Postman company has decided to remove the `Scratch Pad` from the `Postman App` as of May 15, 2023.

Therefore will these images always contain the `Postman App` version `10.13.6`, which is the last version still including the `Scratch Pad` and supporting off-line usage.

Note that you would need to block the `Postman App` from updating itself.

You can do it by blocking the auto-updater downloads by adding the following part to your compose configuration:

```yaml
extra_hosts:
    - "dl.pstmn.io=127.0.0.1"
```

Alternatively you can add the following line to the file `/etc/hosts` in the container:

```text
127.0.0.1   dl.pstmn.io
```
